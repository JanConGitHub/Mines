"<p><i>Mines</i> is a puzzle game where the goal is to find the mines in a "
"minefield</p><br/><p>The minefield is divided into a grid of squares. Touch "
"a square to check if there is a mine there. If no mine is present the square "
"will show the number of mines surrounding it. Use logic to determine a "
"square that cannot contain a mine to check next. If you hit a mine it "
"explodes and the game is over. You can flag where a mine is by touching and "
"holding that square. <br/><p>Have fun!</p>"
