# Mines - Clear the minefield!

This game is a fork of Robert Ancell's original work, which was inspired by various earlier games of the Minesweeper genre, dating back to Jerimac Ratliff's Cube, which was developed some time in the 60s. If you enjoy this game and you ever happen to meet one of them, please consider treating them for a decent cup of coffee, they really deserve it!
